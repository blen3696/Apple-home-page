            <p>* Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple
                 Gift Card when they purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through
                  September 30, 2024. Gift card values may vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple
                  Gift Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability.
                   While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value
                    of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for
                     all items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding 
                     the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI)
                      purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment
                       option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount
                        equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This
                         will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product
                          discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months
                           for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over 
                           the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price
                            of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged 
                            for the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the Eligible Product.
                            
                            Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available
                            
                            if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store 
                            locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject
                             to credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information
                             about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept
                              an Apple Card on and or after February 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, 
                              range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of February 1, 2024. Existing
                             cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible 
                             product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject 
                            to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the 
                            variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or
                            Verizon as your carrier when you check out. 
                             An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time.
                            ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores:
                             Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; 
                            Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs;
                            or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s
                            purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is
                            subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment
                            term lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information
                            about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for
